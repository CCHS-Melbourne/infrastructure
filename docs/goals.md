# Why do we want CCHS servers?

Other than reclaiming the (arguably long lost) self-hosting skillset in the SaaS era, here's some ideas that motivate having servers at the hackerspace.

Subject to triage and discussion among members. As heard IRL at the space, members are talking about:

* Running a CCHS Mastodon instance.
* A matrix.org server wtih bridges to different chat services, good for hackerspace outreach.
* NodeRed.
* HomeAssistant.
* https://jaimyn.dev/portfolio/membermatters/
* Pi-Hole/AdGuard for Ad filtering on the local network.
* Minecraft server.
* Inference server for WhisperX, Ollama and accompanying interesting models (i.e Llama 3.1).
* LibreNMS.
* Grafana/Prometheus.
* K3S test cluster for training purposes.
* VPN (Wireguard) for remote administration.
* Ghidra server for collaborative reverse engineering
* Gitea
